# Fullstack User Management Application

This repository contains the solution to a fullstack technical challenge using:

- **Backend**: NestJS + PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router) + React Query + ShadCN UI

---

##  Project Structure
â”œâ”€â”€ api/ # NestJS backend (Users API)
â”œâ”€â”€ fe/ # Next.js frontend (User dashboard)
â””â”€â”€ README.md # You're here!

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

Each application (`api/` and `fe/`) is fully isolated and contains its own setup instructions in its respective `README.md`.

The frontend intentionally repeats some requests (e.g., after login), which could be optimized with further enhancements (e.g., React Query deduplication, persisted auth state).
If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out. Thanks for reviewing!
